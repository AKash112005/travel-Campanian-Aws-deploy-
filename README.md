🌍 Travel Companion – Serverless Web Application
  📌 Project Overview
  
    Travel Companion is a cloud-based web application designed to help users explore travel destinations and access useful travel-related information through a modern, responsive interface.
    
    The application is built using TypeScript for the frontend and deployed using a serverless architecture on AWS, ensuring scalability, reliability, and cost-efficiency.
    
    This project demonstrates full-stack development skills along with practical experience in deploying applications on cloud infrastructure.

🏗️ Architecture Overview

    The application follows a serverless architecture using the following AWS services:
    
    Amazon S3 – Hosts the static frontend application
    
    AWS Lambda – Handles backend logic and processes requests
    
    Amazon API Gateway – Exposes backend functionality as secure HTTP endpoints
    
    Application Flow
    
    Users access the web application hosted on Amazon S3.
    
    The TypeScript-based frontend sends requests to API Gateway.
    
    API Gateway triggers AWS Lambda functions.
    
    Lambda processes the request and returns travel-related data.
    
    The frontend dynamically updates the user interface.
